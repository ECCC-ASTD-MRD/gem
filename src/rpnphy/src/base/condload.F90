!Notes
!  9/18/88...This precipitation fallout scheme is based on the scheme
!  used by Ogura and Cho (1973). Liquid water fallout from a parcel
!  is calculated using the equation dq=-rate*q*dt, but to simulate a
!  quasi-continuous process, and to eliminate a dependency on vertical
!  resolution, this is expressed as q=q*exp(-rate*dz).

!                              Estimate the vertical velocity so that
!                              an average vertical velocity can be
!                              calculated to estimate the time required
!                              ascent between model levels.

      QEST=0.5*(QTOT+QNEW)

!                              Solve for the vertical motion.

!                              RATIO3 is the fraction of liquid water
!                              in fresh condensate.
!                              RATIO4 is the fraction of liquid water in
!                              the total amount of condensate involved
!                              in the precipitation process.
!                              Note that only 60% of the fresh condensate
!                              is allowed to participate in the conversion
!                              process.
