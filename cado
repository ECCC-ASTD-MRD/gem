# Explanation that this is not part of the CMake workflow but is just a helper
# to save some typing.
#
# Basically there are two commands to know:
#
# 1. Configure a build directory.  Generate makefiles
#
#      cmake -S SOURCE_DIR -B BUILD_DIR [-DOPTION=VALUE ...]
#
#   The options are provided by the project maintainers to enable the users
#   to change aspects of the build process without needing to understand cmake.
#
#   This is also equivalent to doing
#
#      mkdir BUILD_DIR
#      cd BUILD_DIR
#      cmake SOURCE_DIR
#
# 2. Building the entire project or single targets
#
#      cmake --build BUILD_DIR [--target TARGET] [-- -j [N]]
#
#   this is exactly equivalent to CD'ing into BUILD_DIR and doing
#
#      make [-j N] [TARGET]

Shortcuts for configuring and building ${this_project}.

\033[1mDESCRIPTION\033[0m:
    This project is configured using CMake.  To get started, you must first run
    one of the \`cado cmake*\` commands which will configure the project to be
    built following certain options described below.
    
    Once this is done, one of the other commands (build, work, package, clean)
    may be used build the project and possibly install it to the working
    directory

\033[1mCOMMANDS\033[0m:
  \033[4mconfiguration\033[0m:
    \033[1mcmake\033[0m:
        Generate Makefiles for building the project with installed RPN
        dependencies when at CMC, or with their sources outside CMC.
    \033[1mcmake-static\033[0m:
        Generate Makefiles for building the project with static Intel libraries.
    \033[1mcmake-all\033[0m:
        Generate Makefiles for building the project with the RPN libraries
        included as submodules instead of the system-installed ones.  This
        allows the developer to be exactly sure what they are using at the cost
        of longer build time.
    \033[1mcmake-debug\033[0m:
        Generate Makefiles for compiling with debug flags. 
    \033[1mcmake-debug-extra\033[0m:
        Generate Makefiles for compiling with debug flags and extra checks.

  \033[4mbuilding\033[0m:
    Additional arguments will be passed to the build tool (make).  For example
    \`cado build -j\`
    \033[1mbuild\033[0m:
        Build the entire project
    \033[1mwork\033[0m:
        Build the entire project and install it in the working directory
    \033[1mpackage\033[0m:
        Build the entire project and create an SSM package.
    \033[1mclean\033[0m:
        Clean all build artifacts (.o, .a, .so, and executables)
  
NOTE:
    - Because CMake supports and encourages out-of-tree builds, the equivalent of
      distclean target from the GNU standard is simply removing the build directory.
    - Running one of the cmake commands after another can change some build options
      for example, running \`cado cmake-all\` will cause the project to be built
      with the RPN libraries included as submodules.  It is possible to switch to
      building with the system RPN libraries by running \`cado cmake\` without
      needing to delete the build directory and start over.
